## ðŸ“Œ Usage Tips

* Navigate to `/customers` to view and manage customer records.
* Use `/customers/from_A-E` or other routes to filter customers alphabetically.
* Try adding and editing a customer to see validation and success alerts in action.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

Behind the scenes:

* `CustomerController` orchestrates routing and input.
* `IInvoiceManagerService` handles business logic (plug in a DB or use in-memory).
* Razor Views render dynamic customer lists with categories.
* TempData ensures feedback persists across redirects.
