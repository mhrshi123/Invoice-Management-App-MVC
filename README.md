## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Visual Studio 2022+ (or Rider, VS Code)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Invoice-Management-App-MVC.git
cd Invoice-Management-App-MVC
dotnet restore
dotnet run --project InvoiceApp.Web
````

Then navigate to `http://localhost:5000/customers` in your browser.

## 📌 Usage Tips

* Navigate to `/customers` to view and manage customer records.
* Use `/customers/from_A-E` or other routes to filter customers alphabetically.
* Try adding and editing a customer to see validation and success alerts in action.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Behind the scenes:

* `CustomerController` orchestrates routing and input.
* `IInvoiceManagerService` handles business logic (plug in a DB or use in-memory).
* Razor Views render dynamic customer lists with categories.
* TempData ensures feedback persists across redirects.
